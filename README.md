# 🐍 Python & Ethical Hacking Projects

This repository contains tools and scripts built while completing the **"Learn Python & Ethical Hacking From Scratch"** course by Zaid Sabih on Udemy.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Python scripting for penetration testing
- Network automation and scanning
- Custom backdoors, keyloggers, and brute-force scripts
- Packet sniffing and crafting with Scapy
- Ethical hacking principles and attacker mindset

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- `socket`, `subprocess`, `os`, `threading`, `time`
- [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/)
- Kali Linux
