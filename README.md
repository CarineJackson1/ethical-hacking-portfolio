# Full Ethical Hacking Portfolio

Welcome to my **Ethical Hacking Portfolio**, showcasing practical bug bounty reconnaissance and custom Python security tools I've developed and used.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

### 1. Bug Bounty Recon & Reporting  
Explore how I perform reconnaissance, safe vulnerability testing, and write professional bug reports for legal bug bounty programs.  
Location: [`01-bug-bounty-recon/`](./01-bug-bounty-recon)

### 2. Python Security Tools  
A collection of Python scripts that automate penetration testing tasks like port scanning, sniffing, brute forcing, and more — built from scratch for learning and lab use.  
Location: [`02-python-security-tools/`](./02-python-security-tools)
